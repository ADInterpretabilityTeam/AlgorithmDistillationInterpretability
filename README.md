Initial Goals: produce a decision transformer and train it successfully on a task from minigrid. 

In steps:
1. Implement a decision transformer [using transformerlens](https://github.com/neelnanda-io/TransformerLens)
2. Implement a minigrid environment [using gym-minigrid](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Minigrid)
3. Train a decision transformer on minigrid [using pseudo code from paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.01345.pdf)
4. Evaluate the decision transformer on minigrid by visually inspecting the performance.
